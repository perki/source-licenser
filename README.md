# Source Licenser

Add license information to source files. 

- Detect existing license content and replace it if needed.
- Can be extended for other file types. 

How it works

- Actions are defined per fileTypes ex: `.js` , `REAMDE.md`, `package.json`. 

- As per `v1.0.0` Actions can be: 

  - `addHeader` :  Add license text at the beginning of the file. Comment characters can be defined.

    â€‹	Exemple: for `.js` file add

    ```javascript
    /**
     * license content
     */
    ```

  - `addTrailer`: Add license text at the end of the file. Comment characters can be defined.

  - `addSibling`: Add a `LICENSE` text file at the same level as the matching file.

  - `json`: Add or Complete fields of json files. (Ex: package.json)

### Installation
